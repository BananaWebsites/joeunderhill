          I am Joe Underhill, a Bojangles employee of 10 months who earned Employee of the Month in September and a customer service badge, with a strong passion for making espresso drinks and latte art. I also hold a CompTIA A+ certification and am currently working on Network+, with the ability to solve 95% of operating system issues in under 30 minutes across macOS, Windows, and Linux. I have hands-on experience assembling and repairing desktop and laptop hardware, and I enjoy explaining technical concepts in simple terms. With over 8 years of interest in computer science and 6 years of game development, I am building a C++ game engine and have completed projects like networking a Raspberry Pi, setting up an AWS cloud VPN from scratch, and running services on Ubuntu Server.
